\section{Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a pivotal force in the field of biomedical engineering, driving innovation and enhancing the capabilities of medical professionals. This article explores the transformative impact of AI across various domains within biomedical engineering, including medical imaging, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.

\section{AI in Medical Imaging}
AI has significantly improved diagnostic imaging by leveraging advanced algorithms to analyze complex medical images. Traditional imaging methods rely heavily on the expertise of radiologists, who manually examine images for anomalies. AI enhances this process by using deep learning models to identify patterns and detect abnormalities with high accuracy. This not only increases diagnostic precision but also reduces the likelihood of human error. Table 1 illustrates the benefits and challenges of traditional imaging versus AI-enhanced imaging, highlighting the improvements in diagnostic capabilities.
\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diagnostic Imaging:} AI algorithms, particularly deep learning, are used to analyze medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
    \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition:} AI helps in identifying patterns and anomalies that might be missed by human eyes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increased accuracy in diagnostics.
    \item Reduction in human error.
    \item Faster processing of large datasets.
\end{itemize}

\section{AI in Drug Discovery}
The drug discovery process has been notoriously time-consuming and costly. AI addresses these challenges by analyzing molecular structures and predicting their interactions, thereby accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, AI optimizes the design and analysis of clinical trials, ensuring that they are more efficient and effective. Chart 1 presents a comparison of the year and number of AI-assisted involved in traditional drug discovery methods versus AI-enhanced processes.
\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Molecular Analysis:} AI models predict how different molecules will interact.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Trials:} AI optimizes the design and analysis of clinical trials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accelerates the drug discovery process.
    \item Reduces costs associated with R\&D.
    \item Improves success rates of new drugs.
\end{itemize}

\section{AI in Personalized Medicine}
Personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift in healthcare, where treatments are tailored to individual patients based on their genetic profiles and other personal data. AI plays a crucial role in this by processing vast amounts of genomic information and predicting disease progression and treatment responses. This leads to customized treatment plans that are more effective and have better patient outcomes. The workflow of personalized medicine, from genomic analysis to treatment planning, is depicted in Figure 2.
\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Genomic Analysis:} AI processes genetic information to tailor treatments to individual patients.
    \item \textbf{Predictive Analytics:} AI predicts disease progression and treatment outcomes based on patient data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Customized treatment plans.
    \item Improved patient outcomes.
    \item Efficient use of medical resources.
